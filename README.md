# Wren CLI

## The CLI project is a small and simple REPL and CLI tool for running Wren scripts.

It is backed by [libuv](http://libuv.org/) to implement IO functionality, and is a work in progress.

For documentation and usage, see http://wren.io/cli   
For more information about Wren, the language used by the CLI, see http://wren.io

Like with Wren itself, we welcome [contributions][contribute].

## To build the Wren CLI

### Windows

The `projects/vs20xx` folders contain Visual Studio projects. 

### macOS

The `projects/xcode` folder contains an Xcode project. 

The `projects/make.mac` folder also contains a `make` project.   
From that folder, run `make`.

`cd projects/make.mac`   
`make`

### Linux

The `projects/make` folder contains a `make` project.   
From that folder, run `make`.

`cd projects/make`   
`make`

### FreeBSD

The `projects/make.bsd` folder contains a `make` project.   
From that folder, run `make`.

`cd projects/make.bsd`   
`gmake`

## Alternative build options

The projects are generated by premake, found inside `projects/premake`.   
You can use premake5 (alpha 14 was used) to generate other projects.   
Generate other system's projects via the premake `--os` flag,    
i.e if on linux, `premake vs2019 --os=windows` is valid.
